<h1 align="center">Hi! This is my first freelance project.</h1>

<hr>
<p>I received quite a bit of money for this order, but I acquired a lot of useful skills, realized that any obstacles are not terrible, that it is not difficult to learn while writing code. The code is not the cleanest (don't look into JS), but I learned a lot of lessons for myself, I used my pumped skills already in the next project.</p>
